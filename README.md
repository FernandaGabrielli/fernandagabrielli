## Hello! I’m mostly called Gabs. I just love coding, seriously. I’m not sure when it all started, but I can say I’ve had some things in my cloud since I began learning HTML at eleven. Back then, I saw it just as a hobby, something I did as an enthusiast. But when I was twenty-one, I realized this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. It’s not just a hobby, but something I love that makes me feel fulfilled, and since then, that’s what I’ve been doing.

## Technologies I use 🛠️ 
    Languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
    Frameworks: Django, React, BootStrap, Vue
    Tools: Git, Docker, PostgreSQL, Cypress, Selenium, Gulp, Grunt
