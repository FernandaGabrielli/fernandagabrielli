## Hello! Iâ€™m mostly called Gabs. I just love coding, seriously. Iâ€™m not sure when it all started, but I can say Iâ€™ve had some things in my cloud since I began learning HTML at eleven. Back then, I saw it just as a hobby, something I did as an enthusiast. But when I was twenty-one, I realized this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Itâ€™s not just a hobby, but something I love that makes me feel fulfilled, and since then, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been doing.
