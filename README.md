## Hello! I'm mostly called Gabs. I just love coding, seriously. Iâ€™m not sure when it all started, but I can say Iâ€™ve had some things in my cloud since I began learning HTML when I was eleven. By the time I was twenty-one, I realized this is what I want to do for the rest of my life, and since then, that's what I've been doing.
